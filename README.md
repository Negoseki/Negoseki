# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Lucas Negoseki

Iâ€™m a Senior Front-End Engineer with over 6 years of experience. Titles aside, Iâ€™m someone whoâ€™s always ready to dive into a project, get hands-on, and really understand how tech can drive business goals. Iâ€™ve worked across all kinds of projects, and each one has taught me something new about what it takes to make a real impact.

Iâ€™m a huge believer that great developers can pick up any language or frameworkâ€”what really matters is the mindset. So Iâ€™m always on the lookout to learn new skills, explore different areas, and expand what I can bring to the table.

Front-end is my sweet spot because it keeps me close to the user. Thereâ€™s nothing like seeing real reactions and getting fast feedback to make things even better. For me, itâ€™s all about that connection with the user experience and constantly pushing to improve.

## ðŸŽ® Gaming Enthusiast

My love for games is what first got me into tech! Sometimes I dabble in game development, exploring how games are built and trying out small projects. Creativity for a full game isnâ€™t quite there yet, but Iâ€™d love to keep learning and maybe bring an idea to life someday!
